Along this journey, there are some takeawayes I gained and would like to share. Hopefully it will help you learn React testing from my experience and avoid some rookie mistakes.</p>\\n<p>At this moment when writing the test code for the components, there are two concepts we should bear in mind. These two would indicate <strong>what and how</strong> we would like to test, and even how we write React componnets in general.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The UI should only reflect one snapshot of the State</li>\\n<li>The only way to change the State is to dispatch actions</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>So the testing would be devided into two parts: <strong>Render</strong> and <strong>Behavior</strong>. And there are different <em>how-to</em>s and <em>tips</em> in each part.</p>\\n<h2>Render</h2>\\n<p>This part of the test mainly aims for the rendered components created in the <code>render</code> cycle. And since in the React/Redux framework we split the components into the <em>Dumb</em> and the <em>Smart</em> ones, this part would focus on those <em>Dumb</em> ones.</p>\\n<h3>Goal</h3>\\n<p>To verify the existence of the test target base on the prop/state data</p>\\n<h3>Tool</h3>\\n<p>In this case, <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html\\\"><code>react-addons-test-utils</code></a> has been taken advantages of, specificly these methods below I have found very helpful.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#scryrendereddomcomponentswithclass\\\">findRenderedDOMComponentWithClass</a> - to find the <strong>only</strong> one rendered component by its class name in the tree, otherwise it would throw an <em>un-matched</em> error.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#scryrendereddomcomponentswithclass\\\">scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass</a> - to find all the rendered components by the class name in the tree. This will always return an array, either an empty one or not.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>And of course, there are two other variations of these two but to find rendred components by <code>Tag</code>.</p>\\n<h3>Case Study</h3>\\n<p>For a <strong>Dumb component</strong> like this:</p>\\n<pre><code>const AComponent = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> =&gt;</span> (&lt;input className=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"test\\\"</span> placeholder=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"haha\\\"</span> value=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"lala\\\"</span> /&gt;);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The test code would look like:</p>\\n<pre><code>describe('render', () =&gt; {\\n    it('should create the input', () =&gt; {\\n        const componentInstance = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">&lt;AComponent</span> {...defaultProps} /&gt;)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        const inputEl = TestUtils.scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">componentInstance</span>, 'test')<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        // Or const inputEl = TestUtils.scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithTag(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">componentInstance</span>, 'input')<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        expect(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">inputEl</span>).to.have.length(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n    })<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n})<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice that we just check its existence by checking the length of what we can find in the tree.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>For a more complicated case where the UI depends on the variation of the props.</p>\\n<pre><code>export <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">default</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">BComponent</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">extends</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">React</span>.<span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Component</span> </span>{\\n    render() {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> &lt;div&gt;\\n            {<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.buildList()}\\n        &lt;/div&gt;;\\n    }\\n    buildList() {\\n        const {items} = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props;\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> items.map((i, k) =&gt; (&lt;div className=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"item\\\"</span> key={k} &gt;{i}&lt;/div&gt;));\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The test code would look like:</p>\\n<pre><code>describe('render', () =&gt; {\\n    it('should create a list one item', () =&gt; {\\n        const props = {\\n            items: ['a']\\n        }<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        const componentInstance = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">&lt;BComponent</span> {...props} /&gt;)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        const inputEl = TestUtils.scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">componentInstance</span>, 'item')<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        expect(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">inputEl</span>).to.have.length(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n    })<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n\\n    it('should create a list two items', () =&gt; {\\n        const props = {\\n            items: ['a', 'b']\\n        }<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        const componentInstance = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">&lt;BComponent</span> {...props} /&gt;)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        const inputEl = TestUtils.scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">componentInstance</span>, 'item')<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        expect(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">inputEl</span>).to.have.length(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n    })<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n})<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Behavior</h2>\\n<p>The behavior (dispatching actions) is the only way to change the global State.

Along this journey, there are some takeawayes I gained and would like to share. Hopefully it will help you learn React testing from my experience and avoid some rookie mistakes.</p>\\n<p>At this moment when writing the test code for the components, there are two concepts we should bear in mind. These two would indicate <strong>what and how</strong> we would like to test, and even how we write React componnets in general.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The UI should only reflect one snapshot of the State</li>\\n<li>The only way to change the State is to dispatch actions</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>So the testing would be devided into two parts: <strong>Render</strong> and <strong>Behavior</strong>. And there are different <em>how-to</em>s and <em>tips</em> in each part.</p>\\n<h2>Render</h2>\\n<p>This part of the test mainly aims for the rendered components created in the <code>render</code> cycle. And since in the React/Redux framework we split the components into the <em>Dumb</em> and the <em>Smart</em> ones, this part would focus on those <em>Dumb</em> ones.</p>\\n<h3>Goal</h3>\\n<p>To verify the existence of the test target base on the prop/state data</p>\\n<h3>Tool</h3>\\n<p>In this case, <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html\\\"><code>react-addons-test-utils</code></a> has been taken advantages of, specificly these methods below I have found very helpful.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#scryrendereddomcomponentswithclass\\\">findRenderedDOMComponentWithClass</a> - to find the <strong>only</strong> one rendered component by its class name in the tree, otherwise it would throw an <em>un-matched</em> error.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#scryrendereddomcomponentswithclass\\\">scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass</a> - to find all the rendered components by the class name in the tree. This will always return an array, either an empty one or not.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>And of course, there are two other variations of these two but to find rendred components by <code>Tag</code>.</p>\\n<h3>Case Study</h3>\\n<p>For a <strong>Dumb component</strong> like this:</p>\\n<pre><code>const AComponent = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> =&gt;</span> (&lt;input className=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"test\\\"</span> placeholder=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"haha\\\"</span> value=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"lala\\\"</span> /&gt;);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The test code would look like:</p>\\n<pre><code>describe('render', () =&gt; {\\n    it('should create the input', () =&gt; {\\n        const componentInstance = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">&lt;AComponent</span> {...defaultProps} /&gt;)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        const inputEl = TestUtils.scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">componentInstance</span>, 'test')<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        // Or const inputEl = TestUtils.scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithTag(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">componentInstance</span>, 'input')<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        expect(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">inputEl</span>).to.have.length(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n    })<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n})<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice that we just check its existence by checking the length of what we can find in the tree.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>For a more complicated case where the UI depends on the variation of the props.</p>\\n<pre><code>export <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">default</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">BComponent</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">extends</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">React</span>.<span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Component</span> </span>{\\n    render() {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> &lt;div&gt;\\n            {<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.buildList()}\\n        &lt;/div&gt;;\\n    }\\n    buildList() {\\n        const {items} = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props;\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> items.map((i, k) =&gt; (&lt;div className=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"item\\\"</span> key={k} &gt;{i}&lt;/div&gt;));\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The test code would look like:</p>\\n<pre><code>describe('render', () =&gt; {\\n    it('should create a list one item', () =&gt; {\\n        const props = {\\n            items: ['a']\\n        }<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        const componentInstance = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">&lt;BComponent</span> {...props} /&gt;)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        const inputEl = TestUtils.scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">componentInstance</span>, 'item')<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        expect(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">inputEl</span>).to.have.length(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n    })<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n\\n    it('should create a list two items', () =&gt; {\\n        const props = {\\n            items: ['a', 'b']\\n        }<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        const componentInstance = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">&lt;BComponent</span> {...props} /&gt;)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        const inputEl = TestUtils.scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">componentInstance</span>, 'item')<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n        expect(<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">inputEl</span>).to.have.length(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>)<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n    })<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n})<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Behavior</h2>\\n<p>The behavior (dispatching actions) is the only way to change the global State.
